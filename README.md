# Music Releases

Project by [@themisterkai](https://github.com/themisterkai), [@emeliese](https://github.com/emeliese), and [@intehon](https://github.com/intehon)

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

For this project, we implemented a React app that displays Spotify album data. We implemented the project with all the intermediate and advanced stretch goals as well.

To implement some of the more advanced stretch goals, we also used `useState`, such as when showing or hiding our sidebar, or when indicating what header it should render based on what the user has selected.
